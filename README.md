# quran-bot
Twitter bot which posts a Quran verse translation and a link to its tafsir every 2 hours

- Uses a public csv file which contains all quran verses with their arabic translation, verse number and chapter names.
- Each verse modeled as a verse data structure in the program
- Gets a random verse, formats into a tweetable format, then posts it
- Then sleeps for 2 hours before repeating

### Bot is currently running on raspberry pi: @daily_quran_bot on twitter
